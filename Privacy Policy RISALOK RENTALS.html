          Where appropriate and/or legally required, we may notify Members about
          legal requests, unless: (i) <br />providing notice is prohibited by
          the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable
          law, or <br />(ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile,
          ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an
          <br />individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon

        <p>
          If you change your country (or state, for users in the United States)
          of residence, the Controller and/or <br />Payments Controller and/or
          Insurance Controller will be determined based on your new country or

          transfer such personal information to the new applicable Controller
          and/or <br />Payments Controller and/or Insurance Controller. The new
          Controller and/or Payment Controller and/or <br />Insurance Controller

        <p>7.5 Managing Your Information. <br /></p>
        <p>
          You can access and update some of your personal information through
          your Account settings. You are <br />responsible for keeping your
          personal information up to date. <br />

        <p>8. RETENTION. <br /></p>
        <p>8. 1 Retention Periods. <br /></p>
        <p>
          We retain personal information for as long as needed or as permitted
          in light of the purpose(s) for which it <br />was obtained and further
          processed and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to
          determine our <br />retention periods include: <br />
        </p>
        <p><br /></p>
        <p>
          the length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and
          provide the Risalok Rentals platform <br />services to you, whether
          you are a Guest or a Host (for example, for as long as you have an
          account with us <br />or keep using Risalok Rentals) and the length of
          time thereafter during which we may have a legitimate need <br />to
          retain your personal information, such as to manage and protect our
          business, to address issues or defend <br />claims that may arise,
          <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          whether there is a legal, tax, reporting, or auditing obligation to
          which we are subject, such as anti-money <br />laundering requirements
          that requires us to keep records of your transactions for a certain
          period of time <br />before we can delete them, and <br />
        </p>
        <p>
          whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position or to
          protect the safety of individuals, which <br />includes retention that
          is required or prudent in accordance with applicable statutes of
          limitations, litigation, <br />or regulatory investigations. <br />
        </p>
        <p>8.2 Shared Information. <br /></p>
        <p>
          Information you have shared with other Members, such as Reviews and
          forum postings, may continue to be <br />publicly visible on Risalok
          Rentals, even after your Risalok Rentals Account is canceled. <br />

        <p><br /></p>
        <p>8.3 Residual Copies. <br /></p>
        <p>
          Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious
          loss and destruction, residual copies <br />of your personal
          information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited
          period of time. <br />

        <p>9. SECURITY. <br /></p>
        <p>
          While no organization can guarantee perfect security, we are
          continuously implementing and updating <br />administrative,
          technical, and physical security measures to help protect your
          information against unlawful <br />or unauthorized access, loss,

          revised Privacy Policy and update the &#8220;Last Updated&#8221; date
          at the top. In case of material <br />changes, we will also provide
          you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days
          before the <br />effective date. If you disagree with the revised
          Privacy Policy, you can cancel your Account. If you do not
          <br />cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy
          becomes effective, your continued access to <br />or use of the
          Risalok Rentals Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy
          Policy. <br />
